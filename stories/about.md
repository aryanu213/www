I am a student at École supérieure d'informatique in Brussels, Belgium.

I have basic knowledge in C, C++, Java, HTML, CSS, PHP, x86 Assembly, SQL and I
can manage with some scripting languages like bash. I write my reports in LaTeX
and the articles on this site in Markdown. 

My main computer is running [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org "Arch Linux")
with [i3](http://i3wm.org/ "i3 window manager") as window manager.
