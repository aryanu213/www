I am a student at École supérieure d'informatique in Brussels, Belgium.

I have basic knowledge in C, C++, Java, HTML, CSS, PHP, x86 Assembly, SQL and I
can manage with some scripting languages like bash. I write my reports in LaTeX
and the articles on this site in Markdown or reStructuredText.

I believe open knowledge leads to a better world, that's why I support open data
and free software ("as in free speech", more than "as in free beer").

If you learned something new thanks to me, then I achieved my goal, and ask you
to share this knowledge with others.

If you use one of my projects and find it useful, please consider donating a few
µBTC or more:

Bitcoin")](bitcoin:168utA5DWMVXLFVfQDahG5abEWUSk9Wcfm "Donate Bitcoin")

You may have seen my laptop and asked yourself what was this odd interface; it
is [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org "Arch Linux") running with
[i3](https://i3wm.org/ "i3 window manager") as window manager.

## Social

I am present on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mau5kito "@mau5kito"),
[Google+](https://plus.google.com/u/0/100140189944540510085),
[GitHub](https://github.com/bparmentier "bparmentier"),
[GitLab](https://gitlab.com/u/bparmentier "bparmentier") and
[Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/3997816/bruno-parmentier "User Bruno Parmentier").

You won't find me on Facebook (anymore), because I care about my privacy and I
was tired of constantly having to keep an eye on changing privacy settings and
loosing my time on the site.

You can contact me by email at <bp@brunoparmentier.be>.
