Hello! You just landed on my personal website. You will find a
[blog](/blog/index.html) and a list of [projects](/projects.html) I made. I
don't write a lot, but when I do, it is generally about free software,
Android/web development or (Arch) Linux configuration.

The site is powered by [Nikola](https://getnikola.com/ "Nikola website"), a
static website and blog generator written in Python. You can browse my articles
by [tag](blog/categories/ "Tags") and subscribe to the
[RSS feed](/blog/rss.xml "RSS feed"). The sources are stored on
[GitHub](https://github.com/bparmentier/www).

I also have a [wiki](https://wiki.brunoparmentier.be) where I put notes about
hardware I own and software I use.
