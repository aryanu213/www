Hello! You just landed on my personal website. You will mostly find tips about
free software like Arch Linux and Android, which I use and learn everyday.

The site is powered by [Nikola](http://getnikola.com/ "Nikola website"), a
static website and blog generator written in Python. You can browse my articles
by [tag](blog/categories/ "Tags") and even subscribe to an RSS feed for a
particular category.

Note that the `brunoparmentier.be` domain and all its sub-domains are accessible through
HTTPS with a self-signed certificate.

And don't forget to take a look at [my wiki](http://wiki.brunoparmentier.be
"twobp wiki") if you are interested.
